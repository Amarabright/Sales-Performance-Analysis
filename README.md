## Introduction

This is an analysis of the Sales performance of AdventureWorks. It is done by analyzing data from different schemas on the AdventureWorks database. I anlyzed data from dim_customers table, dim_date table, dim_product table, dim_territory sales and fact_internet sales table. I used SQL to query the data from the database and imported into PowerBI where the actual analysis was carried out. 

**_Disclaimer_** This is not a real company as we know that adventure works database is compiled by Microsoft for learning purposes.

## Problem Statement

The goal of this analysis is to
- identify the areas where sales performance is lacking or could be improved,
- determine the underlying factors that are contributing to low sales
- The goal is to collect data on the sales team's performance, processes, and strategies in order to improve their approach and promote revenue growth.
- To discover target markets or goods that have the greatest impact on sales success.
- Finally, the goal is to create data-driven plans that can aid in increasing sales, improving customer happiness, and driving corporate growth.

    ## Data Source:

The data used for this work is gotten from the AdventureWorks 2019 database 2019. I studied the Schema, Objects related to the Schema, data dictionary and found the right tables for the analysis. 

  - You can find a link to get started with installation and restoration of the database to your local machine.  [here:](https://youtu.be/VpY0Q_kwtIw)

## Data Transformation:
- Several structured queries were written to get the right tables and then saved as views in the Database on SQL Management studio.
